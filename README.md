## Introduction to HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It defines the structure of a web page by using various tags and elements.

HTML elements are represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets. These tags usually come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag.

Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
